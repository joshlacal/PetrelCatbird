// Lexicon: 1, ID: blue.catbird.mlsChat.reportRecoveryFailure
// Report that recovery has been exhausted for a conversation Report that a client has exhausted all recovery attempts for a conversation. Any member may report. When votes from at least ceil(2/3) of the active identity DIDs carry a valid epoch_authenticator within the 1-hour expiry window, the server auto-resets the group (see ADR-002).
